## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to classify images as either containing a dog or a cat. To achieve this, we employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a type of deep learning model particularly well-suited for image classification tasks.

## Data Description
The dataset used in this project consists of images of dogs and cats. Each image is labeled accordingly to indicate whether it contains a dog or a cat. The data is preprocessed and augmented to improve the model's performance.

## Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**: , that means ...% of images are correctly classified. 

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:
- `convolutional_neural_network.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset of dog and cat images.

## Tools
The following statistical and machine learning techniques are used in this project:
- **Train-Test Split**: To divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
- **Convolutional Layer (Conv2D)**: To extract features from the images.
- **Max Pooling (MaxPooling2D)**: To reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps.
- **Flatten Layer**: To convert the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector.
- **Dense Layer**: To perform the final classification.
- **Adam Optimizer**: To optimize the model during training.
- **Binary Crossentropy Loss**: To calculate the error during training.
- **Accuracy Metric**: To evaluate the performance of the model.
